BIM/IFC Import playground
---

Currently working on importing FZK Haus from http://www.ifcwiki.org/index.php?title=KIT_IFC_Examples into neo4j.

I am Still learning about IFC and investigating how to map it to a suitable labeled property graph model.

A long term goal would be to port this to java/kotlin and turn it into a neo4j plugin.

Suggestions and help appreciated!
